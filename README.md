## Features

1. **EXIF Details:** Provides a tabular view of the metadata contained within an image. This feature allows users to examine various technical details such as camera settings, exposure times, and more.
2. **RGB Channel Analysis:** Allows users to view individual channels of red, green, and blue within an image. This feature is useful for understanding color compositions and corrections.
3. **HSV Distribution:** Analyzes the hue, saturation, and value distribution within an image, providing insights into the overall color balance and quality.
4. **Color Distribution Visualization:** Visualizes the distribution of primary colors within an image, helping users understand the color dynamics and dominance within their photos.
5. **3D Color Space Visualization:** Observes the colors in the image in a 3D space, offering a unique perspective on the color relationships and compositions.
6. **Pixel Density Polar Analysis:** Evaluates the concentration of pixels across different angles, which can be particularly useful for understanding focus and composition.
7. **3D Surface (Color Intensities):** Explores the color intensity surface and peaks within an image, providing a detailed view of color variations and intensities.
8. **Color Palette Generation:** Generates a color palette based on the colors present in the image, which can be useful for design and artistic purposes.
